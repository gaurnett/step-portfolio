                <p>Bam! Bam! Bam! Budum! was the sound that I often heard encapsulating my school community in the fifth grade. As I moved closer to a classroom, the sound intensity increased. 
                    When I entered the classroom, I saw four african themed instruments strapped around students. They were beating the face of it to produce a sound that was interpreted 
                    as noise to most people, but it was music to my ears. They called them the djembe drums. This was my first time being around a real musical instrument and it fascinated me. 
                    For the weeks to come I would join their meeting everyday in an attempt to improve my skill as a musician. Before leaving sixth grade I thought about learning a new instrument. 
                    I decided to teach myself the guitar and I gradually mastered the skill as I aged - being competent in the acoustic, electric and bass guitar. 	As I advanced through high school 
                    I viewed music as a form of expression. I see it as an art that I can use to calm myself down or vent negative emotions. I see it as a whole new language; one that I can makeup or 
                    adapt from someone else. It allows me to enter a place where I am in complete control and also one in which my skills can come off as pleasing to the ears of others. Music has made 
                    a significant impact on my life and I will continue to engage my musical persona for the years to come.
