            <p>
                Reggae has coursed through my veins from birth as my heart
                learned to beat to the sounds of Bob Marley and Chronixx. Being
                a musician has not only connected me to my history, but has
                showed me how to be expressive, allowing me to speak my own
                language through the strum of a string or the beat of drum. I
                was never a stranger to adventure, traveling to the beautiful
                Blue Mountains or swimming in the clear waters of the Caribbean
                Sea was something I always enjoyed. My socio-economic background
                has allowed me to have unique opinions on the matters that I may
                face. My opinions may be similar or completely unorthodox, but
                this only makes my relationship with my peers more exciting.
                Interested in finding out more? Reach out, I love lending a
                hand.

                I think we all know how this goes but two of the statements
                below are true and one is a lie. Take a guess ...
